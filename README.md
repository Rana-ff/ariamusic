## What data does Aria collect?
We do not really need to store any actual data.
We only store one basic thing to make sure that everything functions properly.

| Collected Data | Usage & Purpose |
| :------------- | :----------: |
| Server IDs | Keeping track of saved server settings and playlist settings. |

### Do we share our collected data with anyone?

We do **NOT** share any of our user data, since we know how important privacy is for every one of us.

### I want to delete all my data, how am I able to do it?

There are 2 main options available to delete your data.
